## 📖 About
This project is part of **The Odin Project's** Foundations curriculum. The challenge was to recreate a provided design specification pixel-by-pixel using only raw HTML and CSS.

Instead of using generic placeholder text, I customized the content to serve as a mini-portfolio for my exchange semester at **Hankuk University of Foreign Studies (HUFS)** in Seoul. It showcases a my time balancing studies with exploring Korean culture.

## 🛠️ Built With
* **HTML5** (Semantic structure)
* **CSS3** (Flexbox layout, custom styling)
* **Git & GitHub** (Version control and deployment)

## 💡 Key Learnings
* **Flexbox Layouts:** Used `display: flex` to align the navbar, hero section, and the grid of photo cards.
* **CSS Fundamentals:** Managed the Box Model (margins/padding), fixed positioning issues, and removed default browser styles.
* **UI Polish:** Added hover states, "glow" shadows for buttons, and used `object-fit` to ensure images scale correctly without stretching.
* **Deployment:** Deployed the live site via GitHub Pages.

## 📸 Credits
* Design spec provided by [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).
* All photos taken by me during my 2025 exchange in South Korea.
